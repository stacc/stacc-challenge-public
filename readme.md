# Welcome to the Future of Fintech Spring 2023 challenge!

## **Theme:** âš¡ Electricity âš¡

For the past year and a half, electricity prices have been soaring and it affects us all. To help save on prices people have quickly become much more conscious about their usage.

Reducing your power bill is a two faced problem, firstly you have to reduce actual usage, but you can also save by choosing the *best* power provider.
 - There are many providers to consider, and each provider may have their own unique pricing model.
 ([Also doesn't help that most people have no idea about what they are paying. (Norwegian)](https://www.forbrukerradet.no/siste-nytt/ingen-vet-hva-strommen-koster/))


All in all, it can be a bit confusing and a bit overwhelming.

So in this task, we want you to create an application or service that can help consumers choose the power provider that is cheapest for them.
There are many considerations and approaches to solving such a problem, you are therefore free to solve this task in any way you want. You are free to focus on frontend, backend, design or everything combined. Creativity is encouraged!
 - One important consideration is **explainability**. There may be multiple factors that determine if a provider is _good_ or _bad_, please make an effort to detail why we can classify it as one or the other. 

## Starting point

You are free to base you solution from the web application packaged in this repo. It is a Javascript and React application that contains a simple data fetcher and a library for displaying the data in graphs. If you use this repository as the base, please read the [How to run](https://github.com/stacc/future-of-fintech-V2023/blob/main/how-to-run.md) file on how to do so.

Otherwise are you free to start from scratch and take the assignment in any direction that you want. The only requirement is that it remains related to fintech. There are likely many other starting points to take inspiration from, one example being [StrÃ¸mpris.no](https://www.strompris.no/)


## Data

We have created two different datasets that you can either read/copy directly from the folder. One is for the power consumption the last 500 hours for one household, the second is the prices and price models of some made up power providers. They are located in the `data` folder in this repository


The data is also available through an API. So if you for example go to `https://future-of-fintech-v2023.vercel.app/api/providers` you will get the same data.

Endpoints:

`https://future-of-fintech-v2023.vercel.app/api/providers`, `https://future-of-fintech-v2023.vercel.app/api/consumption`

### Design/UX

1. Somewhere where your sketch is stored. This can be a link to a Figma-, XD-, or sketch document or a set of pictures.
2. Feel free to supplement with something that explains what you have designed, why you designed it like that and what you might have improved upon if you were to do it differently or had more time. ðŸ•’ These can also be embedded directly into your design document if your design software supports it.
3. [ Send it to challenge@stacc.com ðŸ“¬ ](mailto:challenge@stacc.com)
